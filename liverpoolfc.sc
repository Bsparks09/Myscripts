I am a proud supporter of liverpool footbal club in England
They have done amazingly well for themselves over the past few years and they are still not stopping
What an era with the introduction of our great coach in Jurgen Kloop
we have to and must win some silverware in this present season 21/22
Lets go lads, You'll never walk alone
